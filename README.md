# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

To help with studying I built a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To add a task click next to the time, enter your text and add the blue save icon to the right. Past events will show as grey, current events will show as red and future events will show as green.

Here is a screenshot fo the website in action:
